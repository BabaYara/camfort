-- A refactoring takes a 'Typeable' value
-- into a stateful SourceText (B.ByteString) transformer,
-- which returns a pair of a stateful computation of an updated SourceText
-- paired with a boolean flag denoting whether a refactoring has been
-- performed.  The state contains a FU.Position which is the "cursor"
-- within the original source text. The incoming value corresponds to
-- the position of the first character in the input SourceText. The
-- outgoing value is a cursor ahead of the incoming one which shows
-- the amount of SourceText that is consumed by the refactoring.

  Split a text.

  Returns a tuple containing:
    1. the bit of input text between upper and lower bounds
    2. the remaining input text

  Takes:
    1. current cursor position
    2. lower bound
    3. upper bound
    4. input text

  Fails when lower and upper bounds are not within the text.
