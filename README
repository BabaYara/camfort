For development purpsoses, you probably want to load CamFort in interactive mode:

   ghci Main.lhs

OR compile to the binary format locally:

  ghc Main.lhs -o camfort

Note, for both of these you may need to compile the lexer and parser first if not already done:

  alex Language/Fortran/Lexer.x
  happy Language/Fortran/Parser.y


Alternatively, to install as a library in your Haskell build 

  runhaskell Setup.hs configure
  runhaskell Setup.hs build
  runhaskell Setup.hs install

OR, for local install (depending how your Haskell install is setup), try to configure
using --user.

  runhaskell Setup.hs configure --user
