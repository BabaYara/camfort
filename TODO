Units 
      * Proper scoping for units of measure (see code21.f90 - NMAX and N)
      * Confirm the signature for MOD and MODULO
      * Consider the UNIT program: 
program square
  implicit none

  real :: a, b
  real, unit(m) :: x
  real, unit(s) :: t

  x = 20.0
  t = 3.0 
  a = sqr(x) 
  b = sqr(t)
  
  print *, a
  print *, b  

  contains 

  real function sqr(y)
    real y
    real z
    sqr = y * y * z
  end function
end program

What happens to z. Currently it does not get copied! Instead, a temporary column should be generated for
it.
